# Needs Assessment Project

This project helps humanitarian actors complete needs assessments for Distribute Aid through a user-friendly web interface. It includes:

- ‚úÖ A **Next.js frontend** (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- ‚úÖ A **Flask backend** using **Poetry** for Python dependency management
- üåê Optional Gitpod support for cloud-based development

## üöÄ Getting started with Gitpod

Gitpod provides a fully automated development environment for your Next.js project, and the development environment is set up with just a single click. Follow these steps to get started:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/distributeaid/needs-assessment-v2)

1. Click the `Open in Gitpod` button above. Note: you'll need to have an account on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/login/) before proceeding with the next steps (this requires a GitHub account).
2. Click the `Continue` button.
3. Relax, a development environment is being set up for you in the first terminal.
4. To access your workspace later, go to [Gitpod Workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). Pin the `needs-assessment-v2` workspace to prevent auto-deletion after 14 days by clicking the three dots next to the workspace name and selecting "Pin".
